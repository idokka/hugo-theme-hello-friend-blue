# Updates 😊

I like this theme and at the point of my [blog][blog] creation I've collected all unmerged forks and add my own changes.

Hope you will enjoy it.

My personal big thanks to Radek!

# Hi there

My name is Radek and I'm the author of this theme. I made it to help you present your ideas easier.

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This theme is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

The theme includes:

- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**][font], made by [Rasmus Andersson][rsms]
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**][prismjs]

So, there you have it... enjoy!
